# GIT_refactored-enigma
I have faced a lot of problem while developing softwares without knowing GIT Commands, It won't happen with you

Here is a list of common Git commands to start a software development project from scratch:

1. **Initialize a repository**
   ```
   git init
   ```

2. **Add a remote repository**
   ```
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
   ```

3. **Check the status of the repository**
   ```
   git status
   ```

4. **Add files to the staging area**
   ```
   git add <file_name>  // for a specific file
   git add .            // to add all files
   ```

5. **Commit changes**
   ```
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```

6. **Push changes to the remote repository**
   ```
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

7. **Clone an existing repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository_URL>
   ```

8. **Create a new branch**
   ```
   git branch <branch_name>
   ```

9. **Switch to a different branch**
   ```
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

10. **Merge a branch into the current branch**
    ```
    git merge <branch_name>
    ```

11. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository**
    ```
    git pull origin <branch_name>
    ```

12. **View commit history**
    ```
    git log
    ```

These commands can be added to your `README.md` or a new documentation file in your repository.
